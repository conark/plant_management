# **Plant Factory - Environment Management** 

**Name: Natsumi Shimizu**

# New Agriculture Style
Smart & Sustanable 

Due to the population increasing, it is said that a food crisis will occur throughout the world within the near future. In Ireland, a country which relies on importing  most of its food, vegetable and fruit farming is not the thriving industry that it is in other countries due to problems with weather and soil. 

Today, various technologies have been incorporated into agriculture. This creates an environment in which vegetables and fruits can be grown even in suboptimal conditions. One option we can examine is a plant  factory. In a plant factory, plants are grown indoors so they are not affected by the weather. In addition,  since the factory does not use soil, food can be grown anywhere by hydroponics or film cultivation. Plant  factories are easier to manage using technology, so we can counter any atypical growing environment to  cultivate efficient and clean farming.

# Environmental Management with IoT

The environmental control system requires using cameras to monitor and record multiple growth factors such as temperature, humidity, light. Timers indicate when to open and close pipe valves. 

**Programming languages**

- Python

**Proposed tech – Software**

- Firebase (Storage, Web hosting)
- Blynk (temp, humidity, notification/alarm)
- Youtube (Live streaming)

**Proposed tech - Hardware**

- Raspberry Pi
- Sensor hut
- Raspberry Pi Camera module
- USB connect Web camera (Logicool HD720p)
- A Box as Factory 

**Functions**

1. Shine the LED light on the plant - set it to alternate between red  and green light every 12 mins. (Originally every 12 hours)
2. Measure and display temperature/humidity on Blynk
3. Feed timing alarm every 12 mins on Blynk (originally every 12 hours). 
4. Real-time monitoring with Web camera on youtube. (Optional 
Recognition of harvest time – e.g. if tomato became red) 
5. Send a notification/message to the phone if the temp/humidity is outside of expected range.
